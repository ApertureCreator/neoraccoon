# Neoraccoon
A fairly simple reskin of Volpeons Neocat Emojiset. 
All .pngs are in 256x256 scale.

I really like raccoons so, neoraccoon

Sourecfiles are extremely limited because most of them are a mess. I believe I've provided the most important ones to facilitate kit-bashing. Sourcefiles are given in .kra (krita file) plus a png, just to help know what each of them looks like.
